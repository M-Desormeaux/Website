                        My personal website project is an ongoing and constantly
                        evolving site containing all my skills, achievements,
                        and projects. Would this technically be inception to
                        mention my site on my site?

                        Most likely to be a randomly updated system I develop as
                        I grow in the makerspace. The goal is to eventually have
                        my own isolated security and home automation system
                        seperate from any grid. The details have not been
                        finalized but for now there are a few ideas for what to
                        impliment.

                        Currently my fixation as I burn through and learn as
                        much as I can about <i>web development</i> from
                        <em>The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp</em>. So
                        far the course has been amazing for my growth as I have
                        some concepts I had practically forgotten about
                        reintroduced to me, as well as bouts of inspiration.

                        is a Developer focused community I am building up on
                        Discord with the help of friends to make a comfortable
                        space for novice and juniour developers get there
                        footing. Currently the community is in it's infancy, but
                        will grow over time alongside my goals and ability to
                        invest time.
