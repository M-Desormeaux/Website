            <p>
                My personal website project is an ongoing and constantly
                evolving site containing all my skills, achievements, and
                projects. Would this technically be inception to mention my site
                on my site?

                Most likely to be a randomly updated system I develop as I grow
                in the makerspace. The goal is to eventually have my own
                isolated security and home automation system seperate from any
                grid. The details have not been finalized but for now there are
                a few ideas for what to impliment.

            <h2>Web Development Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>
                Currently my fixation as I burn through and learn as much as I
                can about <i>web development</i> from
                <em>The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp</em>. So far the
                course has been amazing for my growth as I have some concepts I
                had practically forgotten about reintroduced to me, as well as
                bouts of inspiration.

                is a Developer focused community I am building up on Discord
                with the help of friends to make a comfortable space for novice
                and juniour developers get their footing. Currently the
                community is in it's infancy, but will grow over time alongside
                my goals and ability to invest time.
