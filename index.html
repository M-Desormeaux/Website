                    <h3>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a Software Development student with a passion for
                        Linux, Python, and Automation. Currently in my second
                        year with DeVry and soon to earn my Associate of Applied
                        Science. All while still working towards my Bachelor of
                        Science in Computer Information Systems. As you could
                        guess, my focus is Software Programming. As well as
                        going to school, I am learning web development to
                        broaden my skills and create more things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am working on learning the proper
                        foundations and information to be a successful web
                        developer. I am so very thankful for the mentors that
                        have helped me get to where I am. Thanks to them, I have
                        gotten to a point where I feel confident enough to learn
                        on my merit. Despite this, I would like to ensure a
                        solid foundation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to get in touch with me, the best way is
                        through
                        <strong>Discord</strong> where my tag is
                        <b>m__desormeaux#7777</b>. I am usually online or at the
                        least have my notifications to where I can see I have
                        received a message. I can also be reached on
                        <strong>Twitter</strong> at
                        <strong>@m__desormeaux</strong>, while I am not terribly
                        active I do get messages and notifications.
